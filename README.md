# Alarms
 This project is for Linq Case Company, for the the Stellantis group project and future projects. The project has both front end and back end for the visualization
and analysis of the possible alarms in the Non Destructive Testing (NDT) machine. To store this information the alarms are stored in a MySQL database and then connected 
to C#.
